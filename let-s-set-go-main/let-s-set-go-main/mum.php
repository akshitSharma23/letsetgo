	  <p> 
      The city is a modern metropolis whose history is now fast fading into obscurity. Although many may not know the story about the birth of this beautiful city, Mumbaikars are passionate about their rich past and heritage. The name Mumbai is an eponym, derived from the name of a local Goddess called Mumbadevi. The history of this beautiful city dates back to the formation of the seven islands, namely Colaba, Mazagaon, Mahim, Parel, Bombay Island, Worli and Old Woman's Island. This group of islands infact formed a part of the kingdom of Ashoka, the famed Buddhist emperor of India. Following the death of the king, the ownership of these islands was passed on and they were later colonized by a number of different rulers.

	  <p> 
      The Bandra–Worli Sea Link is a 5.6 km long, 8-lane wide bridge that links Bandra in the Western Suburbs of Mumbai with Worli in South Mumbai. It is the 4th longest bridge in India after Bhupen Hazarika Setu, Dibang River Bridge and Mahatma Gandhi Setu. The Famous Bandra-Worli sea link is also known by the name Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link. It is a cable bridge that connects Bandra in the west of Mumbai to Worli which is in the southern part of the city.

	  <p>
      Marine Drive was built as part of the British government's Back Bay Reclamation Scheme during the second phase of Mumbai's urban development in the early 20th century. This scheme involved dredging the sea and dumping stone into it, to create land and expand the city westward. An inscription on a lamp post near Girgaum Chowpatty indicates that the construction of Marine Drive began there, at what was called Kennedy Sea Face, in 1915. It was named after Sir Michael Kavanagh Kennedy, an engineer who was Secretary of the Bombay Public Works Department and a General in the British Army. Unfortunately, he died in 1898, well before the reclamation works began.
